            There are 3 types of accounts in Finitee:
            Individual user accounts are appropriate for individuals who wish to use the app to interact with other users and discover businesses and nonprofits and do not have products and services to display. These accounts do not have product sections and have a canvas section for their personal posts.
            Business accounts are appropriate for businesses that are for-profit and have products and services to display. These accounts have a home section that navigates to multiple product sections that can be used to showcase products and services and interact with visiting users. The business account will only be activated and fully available upon proof of business existence submitted and approved.
            Nonprofit accounts are appropriate for nonprofits and are similar to business accounts but have an extra donations section that allows the user to setup donation requests that other users can find and respond to. The nonprofit account will only be activated and fully available upon proof of nonprofit status submitted and approved

            Businesses and nonprofits cannot find or view individual users in the sonar or search sections. Businesses and nonprofits will only be able to view the events, sales or services listings of individual users if the user sets the visibility of those listings to allow businesses and nonprofits to view them.
            Businesses and nonprofits can chat with individual users only if the individual users allow it in their privacy settings.
            This is because we do not wish to allow businesses and nonprofits to target individual users and subject them to unwanted sales and advertisement campaigns. 
            Individual users can choose to connect with businesses and nonprofits voluntarily and then receive information from them if they so choose.

            Another user can search and find and view you on their sonar screen if your sonar privacy settings allow them. 
            When some other user is viewing you, a viewing icon and number will be shown at the top of the map screen which will inform you the number of other users that are viewing you. 
            Tapping on the “>” icon adjacent to this number, will show a screen where those viewing you will be displayed in a list view and you can decide if you wish to be temporarily invisible to them or not. You can choose to be invisible to them for 60 minutes and this will remove you from their screen and they will no longer be able to search and find and view you for that period of time. 
            You can make yourself invisible to them by tapping on the “On hold” icon adjacent to their name in the viewing list view screen.
            Business and Nonprofits will not be shown who is viewing them in this manner.
            Someone is viewing me and I do not want them to view me on their sonar!
            You can handle this in one of three ways:
            1) Bring up the viewing list view screen by tapping on the “>” icon adjacent to the viewing number on the top of the map screen. In the viewing list view screen, locate the user that is viewing you and tap on the ‘On hold” icon next to their name and you will not be shown to that user for 60 minutes. They will also not be shown to you on your sonar screen for 60 minutes as well.
            2) Navigate to your settings and your privacy settings and change the “Sonar viewable by” setting to either “Connections only” or “No one”. 
            Keep in mind that doing this will make you invisible to all users who do not fit that category, not just the one user you wish to not be seen by.
            3) Tap on the “Make invisible” icon on your sonar screen. You will be immediately made invisible to everyone in the Finitee universe. 
            Keep in mind, though, that no user will be able to find and view you on their sonar when this is set. 
            To make yourself visible again, you can tap on the “Make visible” icon at the same location on your screen and your visibility to other users will be back to your original “Sonar viewable by” setting again.

            I want to make myself invisible on the Sonar immediately!
            Tap on the “Make invisible” icon on your sonar screen. You will not be seen by any Finitee user on their sonar screens.

            A sales listing is a screen that you can create in your sales listings section to display an item that you wish to display to other users in order to potentially sell it to them. 
            The sales listing screen includes the title of the item, the price you wish to get for it, the description of the item, the condition of the item, trait words for the listing, the visibility of the listing, the location and location offset choice for the listing and up to 5 pictures/videos. 
            There is a small fee that every user has to pay to list the sales listing. Once listed, the listing can be found by other users (as per the visibility of the listing) via search keywords that match words in the title of the listing.
            Searches can be performed in both the sonar section and search section and tapping on a search result navigates a user to the full listing screen for the item. 
            A visiting user can then tap on the “Direct message” button to initiate a chat with the selling user to get more information and communicate further. 
            No actual transaction occurs within the Finitee app. Buying and selling users are matched to each other using the sales listing functionality and any transaction regarding the item will be conducted by them outside the app.

            Congratulations! We are glad that the app assisted you in selling the item.

            The “+” icon to create sales listings is not being shown. I cannot create any more sales listings!
            You are only allowed to create a limited number of concurrent sales listings. Once you have created the maximum number of sales listings, you will not be allowed to create any further sales listings. You can delete an existing sales listing in order to create a new sales listing.

            Congratulations! We are glad that the app assisted you in promoting your service. It is recommended that you delete the service available listing even though you may have some time left on it so that you do not get further inquiries about it from other users. 
            Furthermore, deleting the service available listing frees up your maximum allowed service available listings limitation so you can post more listings. Chat with the purchasing user to discuss any details of the transaction.
            The “+” icon to create service available listings is not being shown. I cannot create any more service available listings!
            You are only allowed to create a limited number of concurrent service available listings. Once you have created the maximum number of service available listings, you will not be allowed to create any further service available listings. You can delete an existing service available listing in order to create a new service available listing.

            An event listing is a screen that you can create in your events section to display an event that you are facilitating that you wish to display to other users so that they may choose to attend it. 
            The event screen includes the title of the event, the description of the event, the trait words of the event, the start date, the start time, the end time, the address of the event, the visibility of the event, the location and location offset choice for the event, the require invite request choice and up to 5 pictures/videos. Once active, the event can be found by other users (as per the visibility of the event) via search keywords that match words in the title of the event as well as a match of the trait words of the event. Searches can be performed in both the sonar section and search section and the user can navigate to the event screen for the event. A visiting user can then tap on the “RSVP” button to inform the user facilitating the event of his planned attendance to the event. In the case of a request invite event the visiting user can request to attend the event by tapping on the “Request to attend” button which will then be accepted or rejected by the facilitating user. Within the app, users are matched to the event and any transaction regarding the event will be conducted outside the app.

You can set restrictions on who can view you on the sonar, who can you’re your canvas, who can chat with you etc. A convenient way to manage your privacy is to set your overall privacy settings by choosing one of four setting types:
            Introvert: Use Finitee in an effective but private manner
            Extrovert: Allow other users to reach out and extend your network
            Superstar: Influence other users while still maintaining some privacy
            Ghost: Be completely invisible to all other users
            Within each of these overall settings, you will have the ability to make changes to certain sub-settings. 
            You will be able to always change your sonar visibility settings at any time within any overall setting.

            Businesses are charged a small fee when a visiting user navigates to any of the business’ product section(s). The visiting user is allowed to leave the product section and come back for a period of time and not be charged again. But after a longer interval if the same user again visits a business’ product section, then the fee will be applied to the business again. Also, if a visiting user views a post that includes a video, then a small fee will be charged to the business by the app. 
            Once a user has viewed a video, he will be able to view it again without the business incurring further charges,The fees are accumulated and billed to the business at the end of the month.
            Nonprofits do not have these viewing charges applied to them.

            Finitee does not show ads to users. Rather, it has a pay per view or “hits” model for businesses that are displaying their products and services where a visiting user voluntarily navigates to their account rather than an ad being “forced” on them and the business pays Finitee a small fee for the functionality provided. 
            As it is a pay per view based model, if no users visit the product section of a business, then the business will not pay Finitee anything. 
            If there are a large number of users visiting a business’ product section(s) then there will be a correspondingly larger amount payable to Finitee but the business will have that many users viewing and interacting in their product section which should be attractive to the business as this could result in more sales.
            The idea is to offer businesses a cost-effective model of marketing and branding their products and services rather than expensive and ineffective ads that are mostly disliked by users. 
            Businesses will utilize this model best if they post interesting and engaging content to attract more users to their account and interact efficiently with the visiting users using the posting and direct chat messaging functionality.

            Donation sections are a special extra section that nonprofit accounts have where they can post donation requests and other users can search and find the donation request via sonar or search and navigate to it. 
            Each donation request will have its own page where the nonprofit user’s donation request post will be shown and below that, any comments and replies to comments from visiting users will be shown. If the nonprofit’s privacy settings allow it, the chat icon will be shown so that visiting users can directly message the nonprofit user.
            The idea behind the donations section is to allow nonprofits to make requests and for people, businesses and other nonprofits to assist it easily and efficiently.
