        <div style="font-size: 16px;">At Finitee, we contribute to the public by empowering them to express themselves. With the aim of creating a healthy community to provide pleasant and effective communication within Finitee, we have established some simple rules, which we would appreciate being followed and complied with. 
          These Standards apply to all content including but not limited to posts, chat, traits, service listings, sales listing, events etc. on Finitee; and to all users of Finitee. We are particularly sensitive to content or behaviour that poses a risk of severe harm to our users, and reserve the right to take immediate, permanent action against users engaging in such behaviour.
          Our Community Standards are designed to help ensure that you, and all our users, use our services safely, and must be taken seriously. They are part of our Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy (together the “User Agreement”). If you don’t agree with any part of the User Agreement, including the Community Standards, then it might be that Finitee isn’t for you.

          <br>

          Our Community Standards apply to everyone all around the world, and to all types of content. Each section of our Community Standards starts with a "policy rationale" that sets out the aims of the policy followed by specific policy lines that outline:
